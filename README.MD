## About

Resumehub's version 1.0 was released on November 10th, 2019 and hasn't been maintained since. A little under a year later, we've decided to rewrite the application using Typescript and moved from class components to functional components, utilizing the power of Hooks + Context instead of Redux. During the migration, we've noticed that there was a lot of inconsistencies in areas such as:
<br/>

- media queries
- styling in different pages (fonts, color palette, sizing, etc.)
- reusability of different components
  As a result, a redesign is underway.

### Timeline

Oct 10th, 2020 - Migrated to Typescript + Hooks.
