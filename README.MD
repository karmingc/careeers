## About

Resumehub's redesign was released on March 23rd, 2020 and hasn't been maintained since. As a result, we have decided to rewrite the application using Typescript and moved from class components to functional components, utilizing the power of Hooks + Context instead of Redux. During the migration, we have noticed that there was a lot of inconsistencies in areas such as:
<br/>

- media queries
- styling in different pages (fonts, spacings, color palette, sizing, etc.)
- reusability of different components
- accessibility

<br/>
As of Nov 15th, ResumeHub has been renamed and fully migrated to Careeers.
